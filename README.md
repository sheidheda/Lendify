# Lendify

**Lendify** is a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It allows users to lend and borrow tokens securely without intermediaries, using collateral-backed loans with smart contract enforcement. Lendify ensures transparency, security, and fair interest rates, empowering individuals to access decentralized financial services.

## Features

- **Borrow and Lend**: Users can request loans by specifying collateral, duration, and amount, and lenders can choose to approve or deny requests.
- **Collateral Management**: Smart contracts automatically handle collateral, ensuring loans are secure and funds are returned upon repayment.
- **Interest Calculation**: Dynamic interest rates based on loan terms, ensuring lenders are compensated for the risk.
- **Repayments & Liquidations**: Borrowers repay loans with interest, and in case of default, the collateral is liquidated and transferred to the lender.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven governance through a DAO where token holders can vote on platform updates, interest rates, and other critical changes.

## Smart Contract Overview

Lendify uses Clarity smart contracts to ensure a decentralized, trustless system for loan management. Below is an overview of the core smart contracts:

- **Loan Contract**: Handles loan requests, approvals, and tracking of collateral.
- **Interest Contract**: Manages interest calculations based on the loan duration.
- **Repayment Contract**: Automates loan repayments and verifies borrower compliance.
- **Liquidation Contract**: Handles loan defaults and transfers collateral if repayments are not made by the due date.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using React.js with Stacks.js for interacting with the Stacks blockchain.
- **Backend**: Decentralized, powered by smart contracts written in Clarity.
- **Blockchain**: Stacks blockchain for handling transactions and storing loan data.
- **Wallet Integration**: Supports Hiro Wallet for user login and transactions.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS or Arweave for storing off-chain data, such as loan metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To interact with Lendify, you'll need the following:
- **Stacks Wallet**: Download and set up [Hiro Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet).
- **Stacks Token**: Ensure you have enough STX tokens for transaction fees on the Stacks blockchain.

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lendify.git
   cd lendify
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts (Optional)**:
   You can deploy the Clarity smart contracts on a local environment or testnet using Clarinet.

   ```bash
   clarinet test
   clarinet deploy
   ```

5. **Interact with the Frontend**: Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to start using Lendify locally.

### Using Lendify

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users need to connect their Hiro Wallet to access the platform.
2. **Borrowing**:
   - Request a loan by specifying the amount, collateral, and loan duration.
   - The platform will calculate the interest based on these inputs.
3. **Lending**:
   - Browse loan requests and choose one to approve.
   - Upon approval, the smart contract locks the collateral until the loan is repaid.
4. **Repayment**: Borrowers can repay the loan at any time before the due date to get back their collateral.
5. **Liquidation**: If the borrower defaults, the collateral is automatically transferred to the lender.

## Governance

Lendify features a decentralized governance model powered by its native governance token. Token holders can vote on key platform changes such as:
- Adjusting interest rates.
- Collateral requirements.
- Platform fee adjustments.
- Feature additions and improvements.

## Roadmap

- [x] Collateral-backed lending system.
